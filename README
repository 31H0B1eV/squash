Squash - Compresion Abstraction Library
======================================================================

Squash is an abstraction layer which provides a single API to access
many compression libraries.

The actual integration with individual compression libraries (such as
zlib, snappy, libbzip2, etc.) is done through plugins which can be
installed separately from Squash itself and are not loaded until they are
required.  This allows Squash consumers to utilize a great many
compression algorithms without rewriting code or unnecessary bloat.
Plugins need not be distributed with Squash.

Squash is licensed under the MIT license. Although this license does
not place many restrictions on using Squash itself, please keep in
mind that some plugins use libraries which are subject to more
restrictive terms (such as LZO).

Squash was originally written for, and is maintained as part of, the
QuixDB project.
